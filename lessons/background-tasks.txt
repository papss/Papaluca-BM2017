BACKGROUND TASKS AND SCHEDULED TASKS

Examples of scheduled tasks:

  -sending out emails
  -running tests
  -generate reports
    -ie new user reports

Crontab:
  -a list of commands you want to run on a regular schedule
  -must be edited in a terminal based text editor
    -like nano

Crontab syntax:

22    10    *   *   *   echo 'foo' > ~/bar.txt

Generate a report:

22    10    *   *   * cd ~/rails/app/directory bundle exec rake reports:new_users

  -of course, you actually need to write out a report method in rails first:

    namespace :reports do
      desc "generates new user reports"
      task new_users: [:environment] do
        sleep 5
        puts "we did it!"
      end
    end

Whenever:
  -ruby gem which simplifies the syntax for writing out cron jobs in Ruby
  -

Active Job:

-Active Job is a rails method for generating active jobs?
